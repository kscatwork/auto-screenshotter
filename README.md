1. takescreens.py creates repeated screenshots of the screen and then converts them to pdf
2. combinepdf.py then grabs all these pdfs created in step#1 and then merges all of them to create a singe pdf.

Notes to setup python env on your machine before running above scripts.
1. Navigate to your project directory:
Open your terminal and use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your project files will be located.
2. Create the virtual environment:
Run the command "python3 -m venv .venv". This will create a folder named .venv in your project directory, containing the virtual environment.
3. Activate the virtual environment:
Use the command "source .venv/bin/activate". This will activate the virtual environment, and your terminal prompt will usually change to indicate the active environment. 
4. To deactivate the virtual environment:
Simply type deactivate in the terminal.
